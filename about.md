# About

Welcome to my blog! I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.

## BoxPwnr Project

I'm the creator of [BoxPwnr](https://github.com/0ca/BoxPwnr), an experimental project that tests how far Large Language Models can go in autonomously solving HackTheBox machines and other security challenges.

The project provides:
- A plug-and-play system for testing different agentic architectures
- Support for multiple platforms (HTB, PortSwigger, CTFd, XBOW, Cybench)
- Comprehensive result tracking and analysis
- Full conversation traces for understanding LLM reasoning

## Why This Matters

With recent advancements in LLM technology, I believe that within the next few years, LLMs will have the capability to solve most CTF challenges autonomously. This represents a significant milestone in AI security testing and problem-solving capabilities.
