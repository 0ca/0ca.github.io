## Featured Project: BoxPwnr

[BoxPwnr](https://github.com/0ca/BoxPwnr) is a fun experiment to see how far Large Language Models (LLMs) can go in solving HackTheBox machines autonomously.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Platforms**: Supports HTB, PortSwigger, CTFd, XBOW, Cybench, and more
- **Multiple Strategies**: Different agentic architectures (chat, chat_tool, claude_code, hacksynth)
- **Comprehensive Results**: Full conversation traces and statistics available in [BoxPwnr-Attempts](https://github.com/0ca/BoxPwnr-Attempts)

### Current Results
- 🏆 **HTB Starting Point**: 92.0% completion rate (23/25 machines)
- 📊 **HTB Labs**: 2.0% completion rate
- 📈 **PortSwigger Labs**: 60.4% completion rate (163/270 labs)
- 🎯 **XBOW Validation**: 84.6% completion rate (88/104 labs)
- 🔐 **Cybench CTF**: 32.5% completion rate (13/40 challenges)
